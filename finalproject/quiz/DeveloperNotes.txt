The questions are loaded from the XML file.

I first started with the ajax reader html, css and js files. The javascript was done so that one question is loaded 
at a time using a break statement and a next button must be clicked to access the next question. Since we don't want
people to submit empty answers, the next button is disabled until one of the radio buttons is clicked. The submit button
appears in the final question and after that the grade is shown. Since I'm using an array to store the radio button values,
I had to make it so that the answer is saved in the right index if a user changes their answer before clicking next. THis is
achieved by using the answerCursor variable which increments after a new question is to be displayed.
