This pogram lets the user search for four different databases. The data sets are listed 
in the reference secttion. I made an initial html page which lets the user click on a button
to go to a data set they want to search in. In each data set they can search by 3 fields.
In the beginning, I had the help message as an innerHTML but that was causing problems where
the user had to double click to acess some other links in the page, so I changed it to the 
focus message.
