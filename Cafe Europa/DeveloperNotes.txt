I used the hidden and hover attribute to show or hide the larger image upon hover.

For order details I used a button called check order detail that calls a function and the 
function has if statements to check if a order item was checked and if quantity is greater than 0.
If so, it adds the item to the order total.

Media Print hides some elements but refinement needed. (for future code, i need to divide div tags better)

Table was used to allign order item names, quantity and images. Div tag would be a better option for the future.

Order quantity maximum was limited to 5 per item but this can be easily changed.
